/* 88. Merge Sorted Array
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in 
nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a 
length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should 
be ignored. nums2 has a length of n. */

var mergedSortedArray = function (nums1, m, nums2, n) {
  let x = m;
  let y = n;
  let total = m + n;

  while(x >= 0 && y >= 0) {
    if()
  }
  console.log(nums1);
};

mergedSortedArray([1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], 3, [2, 5, 6], 3);
